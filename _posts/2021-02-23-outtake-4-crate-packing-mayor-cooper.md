EDIT: Clue (l) contains an error;  it should read "Model mooted by Galileo"
<br>
Hello everyone! For this outtake, a new style of puzzle I've seen called "Crate Packing", for example [here](https://southerncrosswords.blogspot.com/2021/02/puzzle-48-packing-crates-3.html). The rules are are follows:
<br>
1. each row (1-15) is a sequence of 2-4 words, as clued on the left.<br>
2. each crate (a-y) contains a single word or phrase, clued alphabetically on the right.
<br>
Good luck!
