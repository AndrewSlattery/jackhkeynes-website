Merry Christmas! To celebrate, I've set what I consider to be a <b>fiendishly difficult</b> puzzle to fill up all your copious free time this week. 😈 Good luck—you may need it!  ([parses](/assets/parses/263.txt)) Thank you to [Liari](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Liari) and [MP](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire) for testing this puzzle.
