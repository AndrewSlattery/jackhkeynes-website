Hi all!
🥳🥳🥳🥳 It's Grid #300! To celebrate, I have a jumbo-sized 23x23 grid for you—good luck! ([squares.io](https://squares.io/info/aeqb7tywevme8mkata93), [Parse](/assets/parses/300.txt)) Many thanks to [Juff](https://www.gnomoncryptics.com/) and [Matt](https://crypticmatt.blogspot.com/) for the initial test, and to the unflagging [Liari](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Liari) and [MP](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire) for testing various additional iterations of many of the clues in the grid.
<br>
