Hi all!
🥳🥳🥳🥳 It's Grid #300! To celebrate, I have a jumbo-sized 23x23 grid for you—good luck! (<a href="https://squares.io/info/aeqb7tywevme8mkata93" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">squares.io</a>, [Parse](/assets/parses/300.txt)) Many thanks to <a href="https://www.gnomoncryptics.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Juff</a> and <a href="https://crypticmatt.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Matt</a> for the initial test, and to the unflagging <a href="https://mycrossword.co.uk/Liari" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liari</a> and <a href="https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MP</a> for testing various additional iterations of many of the clues in the grid.
