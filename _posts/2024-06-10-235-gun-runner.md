Hi all! A 15x15 grid with rather more obscure words and phrases than I usually do—good luck! All solutions may be found in the Collins online dictionary. ([squares.io](https://squares.io/info/cuynpk2pvurpdvfeooo2), [Parse](/assets/parses/235.txt)) Thank you to [Liari](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Liari) and [MP](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire) for testing this puzzle.
