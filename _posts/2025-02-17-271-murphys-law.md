Hi all! An ordinary 15x15 grid for you all this week—good luck! ([parses](/assets/parses/271.txt)) Thank you to [Liari](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Liari) and [MP](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire) for testing this puzzle.

> Doug and Martha from Canada here...we are unsure about 25A and how WITH (A) becomes PER, and what the meaning of the leading + in the parse is. We really love your puzzles, thank you!

> Hi! In 25 Across, the &quot;with&quot; is merely indicating juxtaposition (corresponding to the &quot;+&quot; in the parse)—&quot;next to PER FOR A, backwards DET&quot;. The PER is being charaded by the word &quot;a&quot;, because &quot;a&quot; can mean &quot;per&quot; in for example &quot;once a day/once per day&quot;. I hope that clears things up, and thank you so much for your kind words!
