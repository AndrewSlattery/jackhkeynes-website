Hi all! Apologies for the delayed release; I've been abroad for the last few days and aeroplanes aren't perfectly conducive to setting. This week's grid has a minor theme linking eleven of the answers, so see if you can spot it—good luck! 👵🦆 ([squares.io](https://squares.io/info/n2cgntfp2hmmuu99cbee), [Parse](/assets/parses/173.txt))

> Hi there again from your friends in Canada. We are unsure about 15D, where the best we can come up with is perhaps an AB OUT speaker connexion &quot;jack&quot; on a stereo receiver. Thanks again for your puzzles, we are having a great time solving them!

> Thanks so much! &quot;jack&quot; and &quot;AB (able-bodied seaman)&quot; are both terms for sailor, while OUT is charaded by &quot;specifically trying&quot; (as in &quot;he&#39;s out to get me&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m out to win the trophy&quot;)

> Thanks! Will have to remember this AB = sailor thing. We are learning quite a lot of acronyms, and Doug is convinced that *every* four-letter grouping is British slang for *something*. :)
