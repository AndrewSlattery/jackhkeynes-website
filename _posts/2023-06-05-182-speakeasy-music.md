Hi all! A normal 15x15 grid this week, except that all the clues are exactly five words long. Thanks to [Potoroo](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Potoroo), [Juff](https://juffscryptics.blogspot.com/), Skald, Brad and Agnijo for the testing, and for the warning that this grid may be slightly trickier than my usual fare—good luck!
