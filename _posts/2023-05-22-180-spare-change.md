Hi all! Something a bit tricky this week, a grid in the style of the Times Monthly Club (that is, with gnarlier fill than I'd usually opt for). With many thanks to testers including [Juff](https://juffscryptics.blogspot.com/) and the [Potoroo](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Potoroo) duo, good luck! ([parses](/assets/parses/180.txt))
