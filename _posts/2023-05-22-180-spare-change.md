Hi all! Something a bit tricky this week, a grid in the style of the Times Monthly Club (that is, with gnarlier fill than I'd usually opt for). With many thanks to testers including <a href="https://juffscryptics.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Juff</a> and the <a href="https://mycrossword.co.uk/Potoroo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Potoroo</a> duo, good luck!
