Hi all! An ordinary 15x15 grid for you this week, although for some reason I was prettily heavily constrained in the clues this time—good luck! ([squares.io](https://squares.io/info/sw5smd79dtox4xpwodmk), [Parse](/assets/parses/202.txt)) Thanks to [MP](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire) (first draft) and [Juff](https://juffscryptics.blogspot.com/) (final) for the tests.
