Hi all! A somewhat-themed grid for you this week, tested by the great team of <a href="https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MentalPlayground</a>, <a href="https://mycrossword.co.uk/Liari" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Liari</a>, <a href="https://some-variety.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elgel</a>, <a href="https://mycrossword.co.uk/Tug" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CrypticMatt</a> and Agnijo, who together managed to rein in some of my baser impulses—good luck! 🦹🌍
