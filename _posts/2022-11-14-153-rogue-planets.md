Hi all! A somewhat-themed grid for you this week, tested by the great team of [MentalPlayground](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire), [Liari](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Liari), [Elgel](https://some-variety.blogspot.com/), [CrypticMatt](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Tug) and Agnijo, who together managed to rein in some of my baser impulses—good luck! 🦹🌍
