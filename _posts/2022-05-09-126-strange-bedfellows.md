Hi all! Before we get to today's grid, I have a special announcement: I have posted a new puzzle on MyCrossword [here](https://mycrossword.co.uk/cryptic/438); the across clues and down clues each form sonnets 😀. I hope you enjoy it—I plan to add grids to MyCrossword only sporadic, so rest assured the schedule here will stay the same. 🙂 <br>

Today's grid contains more linked clues than normal, but is otherwise just some good clean (notwithstanding 27d!) fun—good luck! 🤔🤝
