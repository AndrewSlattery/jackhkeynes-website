Hi all! A smaller 13x13 grid for you all this week—see if you can work out where I've been while I constructed this one! ([squares.io](https://squares.io/info/odpkv9o7kjxuveag4ko9), [Parse](/assets/parses/238.txt)) Thank you to [Liari](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Liari) and [MP](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire) for testing this puzzle.
