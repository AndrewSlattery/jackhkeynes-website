> Good morning from Canada, and thank you for these puzzles! We are pretty green at the cryptics still and sometimes are unsure why the correct answer is correct. Do you publish solutions?

> Thanks for the comment! I intend to start posting links to solutions next year (so starting next week), and for grids up to now you can absolutely leave querying comments on this blog and I should get back to you pretty sharpish :)
