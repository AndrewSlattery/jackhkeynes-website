Hi all! A 15x15 grid with rather more obscure words and phrases than I usually do—good luck! All solutions may be found in the Collins online dictionary. ([parses](/assets/parses/293.txt)) Thank you to [Liari](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Liari) and [MP](https://mycrossword.co.uk/Umpire) for testing this puzzle.

> Thanks, Jack! We had toyed with the jack/tar thing for a bit but were struggling with the &quot;ing&quot;. Your puzzles are always a great time. This one really ate up the clock, though! We&#39;ve discovered your puzzles on MyCrossword while trying to find more cryptics. We&#39;ve just about eaten through your entire catalog, here on your blog.

> Hi from Canada, thanks again for another great puzzle! We are unsure about 17A. Deadly sin is lust, but how does Jack become &quot;rating&quot;?

> Hi Martha &amp; Doug,
> &quot;jack&quot; and &quot;rating&quot; are both terms for sailors (&quot;rating&quot; specifically refers to enlisted sailors in the Royal Navy, while &quot;jack&quot; is just sland for any sailor). Thank you for the comment and I&#39;m glad you enjoyed!
