Hello all! This is truly a momentous occasion—I never dreamed when I began that I could reach a hundred grids, and such a momentous occasion must of course be celebrated with a giant cryptic :D Many thanks to all of you who helped test my grids and to everyone who's enjoyed (or suffered through) solving them. Good luck! 🌳🏛️
