Hi everyone! This grid has a rather tricky shtick, but my testers assure me that it *can* be solved... Good luck! ❄️💰

> Hi Jack, it&#39;s your know-nothing Canadian solvers again. We figured out the theme (or we think we did), but are having trouble reconciling 5D (APDICT-devotee?). We are also completely baffled by 23D, as nothing looks like a definition to us and we can&#39;t figure out any wordplay.

> Hi Martha and Doug! Congrats on solving so far and getting the theme :) I regret that &quot;penny&quot;, as well as P, sometimes stands for D (as used in pre-1971 pre-decimalisation British currency), so in 5D &quot;devotee&quot; means ADDICT. In 23D, the definition is &quot;1 {WINE}&quot;, if that helps :)
